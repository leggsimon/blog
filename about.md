I was introduced to coding for the first time in probably 2010 when my brother would show me how to write simple Ruby programs and run them in the command line. I really enjoyed it but for whatever reason it sort of petered out and I stopped doing it.

After getting fed up of selling paint since 2007 I made the decision to really get back into it late 2014. I carried on with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) and free courses from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) and [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/). As much as I liked these courses, without a wider knowledge of how things work (like the internet), it is hard to continue when you reach a blocker. Sometimes you do need someone to help you out a bit!

I applied to [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a 16 week web developer bootcamp, in early 2015, started my course in June, graduated in August (with some of the most incredible people I've ever had the privilege to meet) and an awesome job as a Junior Developer at the Financial Times that October.
